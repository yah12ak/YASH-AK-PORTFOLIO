        "The Paisa Bazaar Credit Score Analysis project aims to explore and understand the financial behavior of customers that influences their credit score. The dataset contains detailed information about each customer’s personal and financial profile  including income, occupation, number of bank accounts, number of credit cards, loan details, payment delays, and overall credit utilization. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the main objective is to extract meaningful patterns and insights that can help financial institutions assess customer risk and make better lending decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Credit score is one of the most important metrics that determines a customer’s creditworthiness. A higher credit score generally represents a lower risk of default, while a low credit score indicates financial instability or irregular repayment behavior. In this project, we will explore how various factors such as annual income, number of loans, delayed payments, and outstanding debt contribute to a person’s credit score. Through statistical analysis and data visualization, we aim to identify key trends, anomalies, and relationships among these variables. The dataset used in this project consists of 28 variables including customer ID, age, occupation, annual income, number of credit cards, credit mix, and credit history age. Before starting the analysis, the dataset will go through a data cleaning process where missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries will be handled. This ensures that the data is accurate and ready for analysis. After cleaning, data transformation techniques such as encoding categorical variables and converting date columns into numerical formats will be applied.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next step involves exploring distributions of key features and visualizing the relationships using graphs and plots. For example, we can observe how income levels vary across different credit score categories, or how the number of delayed payments affects the credit utilization ratio. These visual insights can help financial companies identify patterns among customers with poor or excellent credit scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main goals of this project are to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Understand the key factors affecting credit scores. 2.Identify trends in customer financial behavior. 3.Detect potential data anomalies that could impact analysis results. 4.Provide actionable insights for credit risk management and customer segmentation. In conclusion, the Paisa Bazaar EDA project plays a crucial role in understanding how financial habits impact credit scores. The insights derived from this analysis can help businesses like Paisa Bazaar design better financial products, personalize offers, and make data-driven lending decisions. From a data science perspective, this project provides valuable experience in data cleaning, visualization, and feature interpretation  all essential skills for real-world financial analytics."

Credit score plays a vital role in determining whether a customer is eligible for loans, credit cards, or other financial services. However, many customers fail to maintain a good credit score because of irregular payments, high debt, multiple loans, or poor credit utilization.\n",

Customers with poor credit scores were observed to have higher outstanding debt, frequent delayed payments, and high credit utilization ratios. Such customers should be categorized as high-risk and offered lower loan limits or secured loan products to minimize default risk. Customers with high credit utilization should be encouraged to optimize their credit usage through credit limit adjustments and financial awareness initiatives. Occupation-based lending policies can be implemented, as certain occupation groups demonstrate higher credit risk patterns. Customers with low monthly balance should be offered shorter loan tenures and controlled exposure to ensure manageable repayment. Automated payment reminders and proactive credit monitoring can improve repayment discipline and reduce delays. Additionally, regular review of customer credit behavior can help the business identify early warning signals and take preventive actions before defaults occur."

The analysis revealed that factors such as delayed payments, high outstanding debt, high credit utilization ratio, and low monthly balance significantly impact the credit score. Customers with stable income, good credit mix, and disciplined repayment behavior were found to be financially more reliable. Through detailed visualizations and data wrangling, meaningful patterns and risk indicators were identified. These insights can help the business make informed credit decisions, reduce default risk, and design more effective lending strategies. Overall, this EDA provides a strong data-driven foundation for improving customer credit assessment and business performance."
